       <p>Minecraft was first conceptualized at around 2009, by Markus Persson, who went by the psuedonym "Notch". Early versions of the game were called "Cave Game". At the time, it was a strange game concept, combining the idea of resource management, survival and building all together.</p>

       <p>Since then, updates have added more language options, including fictional languages like "Piratespeak," "LOLCAT," and even "Shakespearean English."</p>

       <p>More recent updates have included diversity amongst the game's biomes, like an update adding new fish to the ocean, or bees to forest and flower biomes across your randomly-generated world. If you were to compare the state of the game now, you could barely call the original Cave Game and Minecraft the same thing!</p>

       <h3> Some of Minecraft's Development Heads: </h3>

      <h5>Jens "Jeb" Bergensten</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead creative designer of Mojang for Minecraft java and bedrock, as well as Minecraft Dungeons.</li>
        <li>Some of his notable changes to Minecraft are the addition of wolves and pistons.</li>
        <li>Often appears in Minecraft's annual live event!</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Agnes "LadyAgnes" Larsson</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Minecraft's vanilla game director (vanilla refers to the unmodified game, or the game purely produced by Mojang.)</li>
        <li>Known for adding in many of minecraft's animals like llamas and pandas, as well as the more recent "lush caves."</li>
        <li>Like Jeb, she also shows up during Minecraft's annual live event.</li>
      </ul>

     <h5>Nathan "Dinnerbone" Adams</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical director at mojang, worked in the company since 2016, before taking a break and rejoining in 2017.</li>
        <li>He is most commonly known for his upside-down avatar, which is also referenced in the game in the form of an easter egg. (If you name a creature dinnerbone using a nametag in game, it flips upside-down.)</li>
        <li>Another notable add-in due to Dinnerbone was the addition of emeralds as a trading currency! They were supposed to be rubies, but changed due to his red-green colorblindness.</li>
      </ul>
